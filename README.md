# Planetary-Escape
The first real and finished app that i created during APCSP, I created this with one of my classmates, and we created an addictive never ending game (unless you lose) with the main goal is to dodge oncoming obstacles and to see how long you can survive. This was my one of my apps when i started to learn how to create more complex codes in MIT App Inventor.
